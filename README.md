# Foundation Sixty6 Website

This project, completed through Fanshawe's Interactive Media Design program during an internship in London, Ontario, involved working closely with real clients to create a digital solution targeting youth between the ages of 16 and 25 suffering from mental health issues, specifically Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, and Psychosis. The website utilizes Vue.js and Laravel PHP to build dynamic front-end and back-end content.

We aim to achieve this by creating a network of physicians and mental healthcare providers who will offer counselling services for free, or at a reduced rate, and by generating donations / funds to support that access.

We also aim to create long term employment opportunities that understand the flexibility and support required by people with severe mental health challenges.


# Usage

Hopefully it gets used as the actual website!
news page

pulls events from events table in main database, and renders each row as it's own article using a loop

If you click on the Read More link found in the articles on /news.html, it will take you to an event.php page that loads the full article contents as a single page.

try /event.php?id=1 for yourself. Just make sure you load the database and run the site from localhost (not 127.0 live server)
